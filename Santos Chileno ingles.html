	The young woman who today is glorified in the Church with the title of Saint, <br>
she is a prophet of God for the men and women of our time.<br>

TERESA DE JESUS DE LOS ANDES, with the example of her life, she places before our<br>
eyes the gospel of Christ, incarnated and put into practice to the<br>
latest demands.<br>
<br>
She is for humanity an indisputable proof that the call of Christ<br>
to be saints, is actual, possible and true.<br>
<br>
She rises before our eyes to demonstrate that the radicality of the<br>
Following Christ is the only thing that is worthwhile and the only thing that makes you happy.<br>
to the man.<br>

Teresa de Los Andes, with the language of her intense life, confirms that<br>
God exists, that God is love and joy, that he He he is our fullness.<br>

Her wish came true on May 7, 1919, when she entered the small<br>
Espíritu Santo monastery in the town of Los Andes, about 90 kms.<br>
from Santiago.<br>
On October 14 of that same year, she dressed in the Carmelite habit,<br>

    <h4>
Some biographical features On January 22, 1901, he was born in Viña del Mar<br> 
Alberto Hurtado Cruchaga.<br> 
<br> 
The death of his father In his early childhood Alberto suffered a painful<br> 
loss: when he was four years old, his father died, so soon his<br> 
His family must move to Santiago, to live as "close friends" in houses of<br> 
relatives.<br> 
<br> 
His mother, Ana Cruchaga, despite the difficulties, found ways to<br> 
serve the poorest in a patronage.<br> 
<br> 
Alberto Hurtado and the Jesuits In 1909 Alberto entered the Colegio San<br> 
Ignacio directed by the Jesuit fathers.<br> 
Meanwhile, he continues to actively seek new ways to serve God.<br> 
and to the neighbor through apostolic works and through his own studies.<br> 
<br> 
Providentially, the economic situation of the Hurtado Cruchaga family improves.<br> 
The long religious training will keep him away from his mother and the country for 11 years.<br> 
On August 24, 1933, when he was just over 32 years old, he was ordained<br> 
priest in Belgium.<br> 
<br> 
On the 25th, Father Alberto Hurtado celebrates his first mass.<br> 
Christ is the reason for his life For Alberto Hurtado, Christ is simply everything:<br> 
the reason for his life, the strength to wait, the friend for whom and with whom<br> 
undertake the most arduous undertakings for the glory of God.<br> 
<br> 
As a priest he feels that he is a personal sign of Christ, called to reproduce in<br> 
within him the feelings of the Master and to spread around him words<br> 
and gestures that encourage, heal and give life.<br> 
<br> 
Hurtado wonders, "What would Christ do in my place?" He is revealing the<br> 
secret of the path of holiness, of his "being contemplative in action".<br> 
And when he exclaims "I'm glad, Lord, glad," he expresses his faith in the risen Christ.<br> </font> </h4>
